Script to remotely restart linux boxes via SSH


## 
Using Bash, I can run this simple script to remote restart various boxes that I work with on a daily basis. 

This is using a simple 'for' loop and it's querying a document that has the host names of the boxes listed in it.

I can add as many boxes as I need to with this.
